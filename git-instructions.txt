Now you can commit to your entire repository in your default (master) branch and whenever you want to deploy the dist directory you can run:

git subtree push --prefix converted-html origin gh-pages

If you get an error, use:
git push origin --delete gh-pages

to delete the branch and after that, run again:
git subtree push --prefix converted-html origin gh-pages
